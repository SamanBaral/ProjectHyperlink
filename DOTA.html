Avatar: Fighting Royale is an online multiplayer battle arena develop and release by Valve Corporation
. Defense of the Ancients 2 is the sequel to the game Defense of the Ancients, which served as the inspiration 
for a new model from Blizzard Entertainment. During the DOTA 2 game, two teams will compete against a total of five online players.
 To protect their own base Map, however, is the primary goal for which the players are competing.
