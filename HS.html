The long-term strategy and tactics of Blizzardâ€™s Hearthstone distinguish it from every other game on this list since it does not necessitate continual 
involvement from each player. Hearthstone is an online card-building game set in the World of Warcraft setting that allows players to create their own decks. Despite the fact that Hearthstone is a free-to-play game, its collectable packs frequently grant players distinct benefits during matches.
Hearthstone, like League of Legends, has grown in popularity as an esports game. Yet recent lawsuits against Blizzard have begun to drive gamers away from the game as a result of the litigation. Even while Hearthstone, as a deckbuilding game. Is more specialised than some of the other options. 
It may deliver a less stressful experience than first-person shooters and battle royales. Despite the fact that it has a steep learning curve and is not a Battle Royale game, Hearthstone is a good (and popular) online option to take up for 2022 and beyond.
